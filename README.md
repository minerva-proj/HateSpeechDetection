Text classification is a critical task in natural language processing, with several practical applications including sentiment analysis, spam detection, and hate speech detection. It entails categorising text based on its content into specified categories. With the increased availability of digital data, the need for accurate and efficient text classification algorithms is greater than ever.
The goal of this project is to create, construct, and test a text classifier that can accurately categorise text data from the OLID dataset. This dataset has a wide spectrum of inflammatory language and hate speech content, making text categorization algorithms work hard. By completing this project, we hope to gain a better understanding of the practical challenges of text classification and develop a model that can be used to improve automated content moderation in social media and other digital platforms.
